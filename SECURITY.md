# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainer or use responsible disclosure.

I will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and aim to provide a fix or mitigation as soon as possible.

Do not include secrets or sensitive logs in public reports.
